## UNDER DEVELOPMENT ETA MAY 19TH (collab rules below)

## üí° Core Concepts

MemoRable is designed around the following core principles:

*   **Context Conductor**: The system serves as a "context conductor" for AI agents, meticulously managing and providing relevant information to enable focused and effective task execution.
*   **Memory as Identity**: We believe that personality is fundamentally derived from memory. The profound impact of amnesia on identity underscores this concept, highlighting how a rich, accessible memory is crucial for a coherent sense of self, even for an AI.
*   **Interwoven Contexts**: Memory items are not stored in isolation. Instead, they interleave temporal, spatial, emotional, and reasoning contexts, creating a rich, multi-dimensional tapestry of experience.
*   **Total Recall Aim**: The ultimate goal is to equip AI agents with "total recall," mirroring human-like memory capabilities for comprehensive understanding and interaction.
*   **Novelty and First Principles**: This project explores uncharted territory in AI memory. We are committed to thinking from first principles to develop a truly innovative solution.
*   **Alliterative Naming**: To enhance clarity and memorability, we strive to use alliterative names for key components and concepts (e.g., "Context Conductor," "Memory Mesh").

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

MemoRable employs a sophisticated architecture designed for "total recall," featuring a dual-model processing system and a three-tier memory storage solution.

### Dual-Model Memory Processing

The core of MemoRable's intelligence lies in its innovative dual-model approach to memory management, inspired by human cognitive processes:

*   **Subconscious Scanner (Gemini Target)**: A powerful Large Language Model (initially targeting Gemini) continuously scans, processes, and indexes the vast corpus of long-term memory. It identifies patterns, relationships, and potential relevancies, acting as a background process that enriches and organizes memory.
*   **Conscious Access Model**: This model directly interfaces with the AI agent's operational needs. When the agent requires information or context, this model queries the insights and pre-processed data surfaced by the Subconscious Scanner, enabling fast and relevant memory retrieval.
*   **Adaptive Context Windows**: The interaction between these models utilizes adaptable context windows, allowing for efficient processing by focusing attention and resources dynamically based on task demands.

    style MemoryStorage fill:#FDEDEC,stroke:#E74C3C
```

This architecture allows for efficient large-scale memory management, mimicking how humans might pay less conscious attention to routine information while being able to quickly access relevant details when needed.

### Memory Weaving: The Fabric of Understanding

A key concept in MemoRable is "Memory Weaving," where individual memory items are not stored in isolation but are intricately linked through multiple contextual threads.

```mermaid
graph TD
    M1["Memory Item 1 (Event)"]
    M2["Memory Item 2 (Conversation)"]
    M3["Memory Item 3 (Observation)"]

    subgraph Contexts["Interwoven Contexts"]
        TC["Temporal Context (Timestamp, Duration)"]
        SC["Spatial Context (Location, Environment)"]
        EC["Emotional Context (User Emotion, Agent Emotion)"]
        LC["Logical Context (Inferred Relationships, Causality)"]
        KC["Keyword/Entity Context"]
    end

    M1 --- TC
    M1 --- SC
    M1 --- EC
    M1 --- LC
    M1 --- KC

    M2 --- TC

    M3 --- TC
    M3 --- SC
    M3 --- EC
    M3 --- KC

    M1 -- "Related via User X" --> M2
    M2 -- "Preceded" --> M3
    M1 -- "Occurred at Location Y" --> M3

    style Contexts fill:#FFF9C4,stroke:#FBC02D
```
This rich tapestry of interwoven temporal, spatial, emotional, logical, and keyword/entity contexts allows the AI to form a deeper, more nuanced understanding of past experiences and retrieve information in a highly flexible and human-like manner.
