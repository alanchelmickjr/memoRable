        "use": "@vercel/node"
      }
    ],
    "routes": [
      {
        "src": "/(.*)",
        "dest": "src/index.js"
      }
    ],

## Risk Assessment

1. **High Priority Risks**
   - Model performance in production
   - Resource allocation efficiency
   - System stability during model switching
   - Cache invalidation timing
   - Memory usage during night processing
   - MongoDB performance under load
   - Passphrase security
   - Response refinement accuracy
   - Pattern learning accuracy
   - Mental health monitoring reliability

2. **Medium Priority Risks**
   - Integration testing coverage
   - Documentation completeness
   - Monitoring system effectiveness
   - Task pattern analysis accuracy
   - Night processing window timing
   - User preference conflicts
   - Attention decay balance

3. **Low Priority Risks**
   - Backup system reliability
   - Recovery time objectives
   - Documentation maintenance
   - Cache storage limits
   - Pattern storage growth

## Next Review Points

1. After Docker configuration updates
2. Following Vercel deployment setup
